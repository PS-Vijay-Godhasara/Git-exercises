# Git Exercises Repository

This repository contains a series of exercises to practice and understand Git version control.

## Exercise 1: Set Up and Initialize a Repository
1. Create a new directory for your project and initialize a Git repository.
2. Create a README.md file and add a basic description.
3. Check the status of your repository.
4. Stage and commit changes, then view the commit history.

## Exercise 2: Working with Branches
1. Create a new branch called feature-branch.
2. Modify the README.md file.
3. Stage and commit changes to the feature-branch.
4. Switch back to the main branch and merge feature-branch into main.
5. Delete the feature-branch locally after merging.

## Exercise 3: Collaborating with GitHub
1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., git-experience-task).
2. Add it as a remote to your local repository.
3. Push your local changes to GitHub.
4. Pull updates from the remote repository to ensure it is up-to-date.
5. Create a new branch update-branch on GitHub.
6. Make changes, commit, and push them to the update-branch.
7. Create a pull request on GitHub to merge changes from update-branch into main.

## Exercise 4: Git Stashing
1. Modify the README.md file without committing changes.
2. Stash the changes temporarily.
3. Verify that your working directory is clean after stashing.
4. Apply the stashed changes back to your working directory.
5. Drop the stash once the changes are successfully applied.

Complete each exercise by following the steps provided. For each exercise, we have already created a separate folder. Inside each folder, create a .txt file for the exercise and add the corresponding Git commands. Once you've completed this, push your changes to the repository.
